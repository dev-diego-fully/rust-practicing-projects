# Fibonacci

This is a personal practice project focused on **experimenting with Rust's testing tools** and methodologies.

The project provides a module for generating the Fibonacci sequence. The code serves as a subject for a series of tests designed to explore various scenarios, including:

-   Validating the correctness of the sequence.
-   Handling boundary conditions, such as integer overflow.
