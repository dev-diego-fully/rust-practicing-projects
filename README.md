# Rust Practice Monorepo

This repository serves as a personal collection of standalone Rust projects, focused on exploring specific technologies and concepts within the language.

Each project is an independent effort, developed to deepen my understanding of a particular topic. These are not part of a larger course, tutorial series, or platforms like LeetCode. They are self-contained projects created for focused, hands-on learning.

The repository is structured by technology, allowing for easy navigation and a clear overview of the learning journey.
